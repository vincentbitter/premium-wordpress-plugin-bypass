# Add-ons for Smash Balloon Feeds

This plugin enhances the free version of [Custom Twitter Feeds](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-twitter-feeds/) and [Smash Balloon Social Post Feed](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-facebook-feed/) by mimicking selected premium features using custom-built replacements.

## ⚙️ Features

- Facebook: Show photos in posts.
- Twitter: Show photos in posts (only if one!).
- Twitter: Set cache expiry period.

## 🧩 How It Works

This plugin modifies specific files from the original Smash Balloon plugins to unlock or replicate premium features. On updates of the plugins, the changes are applied automatically again.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Download the ZIP file from the [Releases](https://github.com/vincentbitter/premium-wordpress-plugin-bypass/releases) page.
2. Upload it via `Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin` in your WordPress dashboard.
3. Activate the plugin.
