# Premium WordPress Plugin Bypass

**WordPress plugin extensions that replicate selected premium features from popular plugins — without requiring a paid license.**

## 🚀 Overview

Many WordPress plugins offer limited functionality in their free versions, locking advanced features behind a paywall. This repository provides lightweight add-ons that extend the free versions of popular plugins by mimicking or replacing specific premium functionalities.

These add-ons are ideal for developers and site owners who need just a small subset of premium features and prefer to implement them independently.

## 📦 Available Add-ons

Currently included:

- `add-ons-for-all-in-one-security` for [All-in-One Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-security-and-firewall/)
- `add-ons-for-smash-balloon-feeds` for [Custom Twitter Feeds](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-twitter-feeds/) and [Smash Balloon Social Post Feed](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-facebook-feed/)

Each folder contains a standalone plugin that can be installed alongside the original plugin.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/vincentbitter/premium-wordpress-plugin-bypass/releases) page.
2. Download the ZIP file for the plugin you want to use.
3. Upload the ZIP via your WordPress admin panel (`Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin`) or extract it manually into `/wp-content/plugins/`.
4. Activate the plugin.
5. Make sure the corresponding base plugin is also installed and active.
